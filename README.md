 - All folders represent one training step as from the training here:
https://www.html.it/pag/401198/introduzione-a-quarkus/

 - As a small difference I'm using Eclipse STS, not IntelliJ Idea:
see what it means below


### Using Eclipse with Quarkus

I installed the plugin QuarkusTools4.29.1.Final, from Eclipse marketplace,
but it fails when creating a project with dependencies, as required in the first training example:
https://www.html.it/pag/401657/quarkus-prima-applicazione/

Unfortunately, using the official Quarkus code generator:
https://code.quarkus.io
the generated code would miss the Eclipse specific project files,
so the trick is to generate a project with no dependencies with the plugin,
see folder "nodeps_quarkus_project", contaning such a reference project,
then copy the folder ".settings" and the files ".project" and ".classpath",
after having renamed the project changing the ".project" file,
from the project generated with the eclipse plugin into the folder generated by code.quarkus.io
