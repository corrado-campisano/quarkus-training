# Quarkus Training README

 - All folders represent one training step as from the training here:
https://www.html.it/pag/401198/introduzione-a-quarkus/

 - As a small difference I'm using Eclipse STS, not IntelliJ Idea:
see what it means below


### List of implemented tutorials

From the various tutorials, several eclipse quarkus sub-projects are implemented:

 - test-quarkus-1 (hello world) https://www.html.it/pag/401657/quarkus-prima-applicazione/
 - test-quarkus-2 (spring support) https://www.html.it/pag/401961/supporto-spring-in-quarkus/
 - test-quarkus-3 (spring data mysql) https://www.html.it/pag/402120/supporto-spring-in-quarkus-spring-data/
 - test-quarkus-4 ...
 - test-quarkus-5 ...
 - test-quarkus-6 ...
 

### Using Eclipse with Quarkus


##### Generating a quarkus project

I installed the plugin QuarkusTools4.29.1.Final, from Eclipse marketplace,
but it fails when creating a project with dependencies, as required in the first training example:
https://www.html.it/pag/401657/quarkus-prima-applicazione/

Unfortunately, when using the official Quarkus code generator: https://code.quarkus.io,
the generated code would miss the Eclipse specific project files.

The trick is to generate a project with no dependencies with the plugin,
see folder "nodeps_quarkus_project", contaning such a reference project,
then copy the folder ".settings" and the files ".project" and ".classpath",
after having renamed the project changing the ".project" file,
from the project generated with the eclipse plugin into the folder created by unzipping the file 
generated by code.quarkus.io (here test-quarkus-1).


##### Running one instance

In order to be able to run "mvn quarkus:dev", a MVN BUILD must be configured, 
so that the quarkus project can be "RUN AS..." the configured maven build.


##### Embedding quarkus test projects in a generic eclipse project as container

This file belong to the root folder "Quarkus Training", as all the test (sub-)projects will be.

The "container project" has been generated AFTER the first quarkus project (test-quarkus-1), without referencing that one, just containing it on the file system.


##### Adding other sub-projects generated from code.quarkus.io

Unzip the downloaded zip quarkus project (for example into folder test-quarkus-2) 
INSIDE the main "quarkus training" folder (and Eclipse project).

Copy the ".settings" folder and the ".classpath" and ".project" files,
rename the project inside the ".project" file and finally import the project,
as a generic eclipse project, into the container eclipse project (main "quarkus training").
